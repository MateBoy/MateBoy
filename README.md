## Hello
I work as a front end developer in Stockholm, Sweden.
I think CSS is underrated as a programming language.

My website is available [here](https://mateboy.dev). Sometimes I blog about things there.

#### Apart from that, I also enjoy
- [Listening to a lot of music](https://www.last.fm/user/MeTRoD)
- [Collecting vinyl records](https://www.discogs.com/user/MateBoy/collection)
- [Watching films](https://letterboxd.com/MateBoy/)
- [Playing video games](https://www.backloggd.com/u/MateBoy/)
