### Hello
I work as a front end developer in Stockholm, Sweden. I think CSS is underrated as a programming language. Yes, I said it.

Sometimes I document things I know and want to remember in this [knowledge database](https://wiki.mathiasborgmalm.dev).

Apart from that, I also enjoy
- [Listening to a lot of music](https://www.last.fm/user/MeTRoD)
- [Watching films](https://letterboxd.com/MateBoy/)
- [Playing video games](https://howlongtobeat.com/user?n=MateBoy)
